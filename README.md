# Computer-Outro
This is a Java based project that turns off your computer to the bass drop of a song that is randomly chosen through a number generator liked to .wav files of the songs.
I did this by creating a random number generator, that can only generate a number between a specified value, and linking a song to the generated number using if statements. I added
the .wav files to a resources folder, and accessing those files in that folder using input stream. Then I would open and start the .wav files and start a command 
that would shut down the computer, after a certain amount of time, and stop the song at the beat drop.
